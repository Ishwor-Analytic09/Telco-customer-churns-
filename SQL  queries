Business Question 1: What numeric features contribute most to churn?

SELECT 
  AVG(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN tenure ELSE NULL END) AS avg_tenure_churned,
  AVG(CASE WHEN Churn = 'No' THEN tenure ELSE NULL END) AS avg_tenure_not_churned,
  AVG(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN MonthlyCharges ELSE NULL END) AS avg_monthly_churned,
  AVG(CASE WHEN Churn = 'No' THEN MonthlyCharges ELSE NULL END) AS avg_monthly_not_churned,
  AVG(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN TotalCharges ELSE NULL END) AS avg_total_churned,
  AVG(CASE WHEN Churn = 'No' THEN TotalCharges ELSE NULL END) AS avg_total_not_churned
FROM telco_churn;

Business Question 2: How do contract type and internet service affect churn rate?

SELECT 
  Contract,
  InternetService,
  COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned_customers,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate_percentage
FROM telco_churn
GROUP BY Contract, InternetService
ORDER BY churn_rate_percentage DESC;

Business Question 3: Which contract type has the highest churn rate?

SELECT 
  Contract,
  COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned_customers,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate_percentage
FROM telco_churn
GROUP BY Contract
ORDER BY churn_rate_percentage DESC;


Business Question 4: Do churned customers have higher monthly charges than non-churned ones?

SELECT 
  Churn,
  ROUND(AVG(MonthlyCharges), 2) AS avg_monthly_charges
FROM telco_churn
GROUP BY Churn;

Business Question 5: How does churn vary across different payment methods?

SELECT 
  PaymentMethod,
  COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned_customers,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate_percentage
FROM telco_churn
GROUP BY PaymentMethod
ORDER BY churn_rate_percentage DESC;

Business Question 6: How does churn change with customer tenure?

SELECT 
  tenure,
  COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned_customers,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate_percentage
FROM telco_churn
GROUP BY tenure
ORDER BY tenure ASC;
